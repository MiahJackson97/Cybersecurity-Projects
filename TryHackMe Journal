Symbol / Operator
Description
&
This operator allows you to run commands in the background of your terminal.
&&
This operator allows you to combine multiple commands together in one line of your terminal.
>
This operator is a redirector - meaning that we can take the output from a command (such as using cat to output a file) and direct it elsewhere.
>>
This operator does the same function of the > operator but appends the output rather than replacing (meaning nothing is overwritten).




Important Takeaways
Linux is an OS, like Windows. There are many different versions of Linux that serve different purposes. 
Linux systems rely more heavily on the command line to do tasks, like navigate the file system. 
Same basic commands while working with files are ls, cd, cat and pwd
